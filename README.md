# Diabetes-Predictor
Diabetes is a common, chronic disease. Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for prediction of disease at an early stage. In this research paper, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes, and the relationship of the differing attributes is also characterized. Various tools are used to determine significant attribute selection, and for clustering, prediction, and association rule mining for diabetes. The svm techinque use in this project provides and accuracy score of 77.27%.
